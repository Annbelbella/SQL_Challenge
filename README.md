# SQL_Challenge


## Background
Beiong hired as a new data engineer at Pewlett Hackard (a fictional company). The first major task is to do a research project about people whom the company employed during the 1980s and 1990s. All that remained of the employee database from that period are six CSV files.

For this project, I designed tables to hold the data from the CSV files, imported the CSV files into a SQL database, and then answered questions about the data. That is, you’ll perform data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis, respectively.

## Data Modeling
Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) of the tables: Created an ERD and also exported a table sechema that i used to create all the tables.

## Data Engineering

The following were done;
- Creation of defined  columns for each table 
- Columns set to the correct data type 
- Primary Keys set for each table 
- Correctly referenced related tables 
- Tables are correctly related using Foreign Keys 
- Correctly used NOT NULL condition on necessary columns
- Accurately defined value length for columns 

## Data Analysis 
Created queries for the following questions asked

1. List the employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary of each employee (2 points)
2. List the first name, last name, and hire date for the employees who were hired in 1986 (2 points)
3. List the manager of each department along with their department number, department name, employee number, last name, and first name (2 points)
4. List the department number for each employee along with that employee’s employee number, last name, first name, and department name (2 points)
5. List first name, last name, and sex of each employee whose first name is Hercules and whose last name begins with the letter B (2 points)
6. List each employee in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, and first name (2 points)
7. List each employee in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name (4 points)
8. List the frequency counts, in descending order, of all the employee last names (that is, how many employees share each last name) (4 points)
